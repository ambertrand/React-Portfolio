                    <p> Aspiring Full-stack web developer with event management experience looking to leverage my strong
                        work ethic and ability to learn quickly. Currently studying in the University of New Hampshireâ€™s
                        certificate program in full stack web development, where I am building my skills in HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript and Node.js as well as responsive and mobile-first web design. Recently completed a
                        project
                        working on a team of four applying aspects of agile development. I am excited to leverage the
                        skills
                        I have learned to help build better web experiences through team collaboration to see
                        applications and
                        software come to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>In my free time when I am not building great web experiences, I enjoy playing golfing, skiing and
                        running.
